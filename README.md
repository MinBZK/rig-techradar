# RIG Techradar

The goal of this project is to provide insight in the technologies used by RIG.

## Remarks

The idea is to provide ADR like files (which we will call Architecture Proposal/Source Records), which
contain global information about a technology and relations to other technologies.


## Local development

You can install http-server with:
```
npm install -g http-server
```

Then run it from the folder gui:

```
http-server -c -1 
```

The -c -1 options disable caching.
