# Maven

For Java developers, Maven is a lifesaver. It's a free, open-source build automation tool that streamlines project
management. Instead of juggling dependencies and build processes manually, Maven uses a central repository and
standardized conventions to automate tasks like compiling, testing, and packaging your Java code. This frees you to
focus on writing great software!
