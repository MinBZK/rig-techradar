# PHP

PHP, which stands for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor," is a widely used open-source scripting language that powers the
dynamic content of many websites. Unlike HTML, which displays static content, PHP code is executed on the server,
allowing you to generate content, interact with databases, and personalize user experiences. Easy to learn and
particularly suited for web development, PHP integrates seamlessly with HTML and CSS to create interactive and dynamic
web pages. A large community and abundant resources make PHP a great choice for building everything from simple blogs to
complex e-commerce applications.
